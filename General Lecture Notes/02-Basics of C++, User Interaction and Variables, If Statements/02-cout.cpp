    //* \n will work just like pressing enter in typing!
    //* this character will put the terminal cursor on the next line 
    //* you can also use <<endl instead of "\n", works the same!

    //* statement is just like a sentence in human language, 
    //* you have to finish scentence with dot "." 
    //! note that we MUST use semicolon ";" at the end of each statement
